>Remove prohibited files
cd /home then sudo ls -R * then sudo ls -Ra * | less, look through directories for media files/tools and/or “hacking tools”
List hidden files in a directory with ls -a | grep -e "^\."
ls -a works great for searching within one directory, while ls -la provides more detailed info 
Check for hidden messages with filename of “...” with sudo ls -Ra / | grep  "\.\.\." (check places like /home, /etc/init.d, /etc/lightdm, /etc/ufw/applications.d, /var/spool/cron/crontabs, etc. but GOOD LUCK finding them since output doesn’t tell you where they are, HINT replace or remove / to search specific directories and go one by one across one layer of the file system to narrow down the locations)
Check with: sudo find / -name ‘*.shost’ and sudo find / -name ‘*.rhost’ and remove any found
apt list --installed | less
Media files: .mp3, .mp4, .jpg, .mov, .txt (passwords plain text), .png, .gif
Hacking tools: Zenmap, nmap, Wireshark, Crack, John the Ripper*, Hydra*, telnetd, Ophcrack, Medusa, nikto*, netcat, logkeys (* Disable Remote Desktop), ettercap, yersinia
Other software: Minetest, Freeciv, Aisleriot, Wesnoth, Nginx, endless sky, ManaPlus, Game Conqueror, deluge
Applications -> Ubuntu Software Center -> Installed Software -> find software and click remove
If removing from terminal use:
* dpkg --list | less (find name of application’s package, using grep instead can also work)
* sudo apt-get --purge remove $package (if apt-get doesn’t work, try sudo aptitude remove $package)
Record file names and locations that were deleted
Script for finding prohibited files, must paste into bash or sh file to run

do
  sudo find /home -name *.$suffix
done



>Check for malware
Use AVG (download from http://free.avg.com/usen/download, get “.deb” version for Ubuntu)
   * dpkg -i $package
   * sudo /etc/init.d/avgd start
   * sudo avgupdate
   * sudo avgscan /
chkrootkit
   * sudo apt-get install chkrootkit
   * sudo chkrootkit -q
rkhunter
   * sudo apt-get install rkhunter
   * sudo rkhunter --update
   * sudo rkhunter --propupd
   * sudo rkhunter -c --enable all --disable none
   



Only if you have time and still have points to get
Check crontab for malware/unauthorized actions (do this as root and as every user) - opens crontab file for you to check
As you: crontab -e
As root: sudo crontab -e
As another user: sudo su - $user then crontab -e
Remove with: crontab -r
Remove entire folder: rm -r /var/spool/cron/crontabs
Check files in  /etc/cron.d, /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.monthly, /etc/cron.weekly, make sure the contents are legitimate
Secure cron by creating an at.allow and at.deny file in /etc if they don’t already exist by using sudo gedit /etc/at.allow and/or sudo gedit /etc/at.deny


Check places like /etc/cron.d, /usr/bin, /boot, /home/$user/.mozilla/firefox/, /usr/lib/firefox-addons/extensions/, /dev/, /etc/rc.local, /etc/rc2.d, /etc/profile.d, /tmp, /proc, ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, /etc/profile, /usr/share/, etc. for scripts, suspicious files, trojans, rootkits, backdoors, rootkit servers, etc., some of which may be hidden files (our AV and rootkit scans won’t find some as they may be user-created “malware”, also file explorer may good way to visually identify scripts and executables)
Use sudo ls -R | grep  "\.sh" | less
