>Secure ports
sudo netstat -tulpn or sudo ss -tulpn
If local address is 127.0.0.1:$port, it is loopback and isnâ€™t exposed
sudo lsof -i :$port (more info, not always needed)
whereis $program (copy program listening on port)
Copy where the program is (first one if more than one listed): dpkg -S $location (note the name of the package given to you)
sudo apt-get purge $package (if no package, you can probably delete it with rm $location and then killall -9 $program) MAKE SURE IT IS NOT A CRITICAL PACKAGE BEFORE HITTING Y
sudo netstat -tulpn (make sure the port is actually closed)


ALTERNATE:
sudo netstat -tulnp or sudo ss -tulpn
Use sudo kill $PID


To check the listening ports and applications on Linux:
1. Open a terminal application i.e. shell prompt.
2. Run any one of the following command on Linux to see open ports:
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
sudo lsof -i:22 ## see a specific port such as 22 ##
sudo nmap -sTU -O IP-address-Here
3. For the latest version of Linux use the ss command. For example, ss -tulw
